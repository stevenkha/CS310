# GeneticAlgorithm
An application that reads an adjanceny matrix from a file and computes a near-optimal path through each vertex.
The goal of this program is to seek the best possible path through each vertex through the means of a genetic algorithm that 
"crossbreeds" the current best paths in an attempt to find a better path through crossover.
