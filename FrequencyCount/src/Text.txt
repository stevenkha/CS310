Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Girl please don't ever let me be alone again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Girl please don't ever let me be alone again
I used to play at love love became
An empty game I walked away from love
I always had myself to blame
I hid my fragile dreams away
My lonely heart was like a valentine
No one cared to read the rhyme
I watched the world go by lovers hand in hand
I could not understand but that was long ago
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Oh girl you taught me how to feel the joy again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart I'll never be afraid
To share my dreams again
And in your younger days girl you hid
Your heart away those were the hungry days
Waiting for someone to say those tender words
That never game fragile nights of wishing on a star
Love was near & yet so far and when you fell for me
I never had a clue and when I noticed you my heart
Already knew my dreams were coming true and now
We smile and say goodbye to yesterday
Cause that was long ago thank you for the hope
Thank you for the joy oh girl you taught
My lonely heart to sing again thank you for your kiss
Thank you for the touch I'll never be afraid to share
My dreams again thank you for your love thank you
For the heart there'll never be a long and lonely night again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Girl please don't ever let me be alone again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Oh girl you taught me how to feel the joy again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
