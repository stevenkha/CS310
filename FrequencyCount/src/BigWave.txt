Out there in the ocean that's my silhouette
Out there waiting where the mountains move
I'm all alone, but I'm at home
Livin' with nothing left to prove
We've got summer right here in our hearts
And we move with the tide
We just float in the sun 'til the big wave comes
Then we ride ride ride
Looking for the pieces of a shattered dream
Running out of places to be free
No where to go, I only know
I hear the thunder calling me
We've got summer right here in our hearts
And we move with the tide
We just float in the sun 'til the big wave comes
Then we ride ride ride
There was this girl, another world
But I hear the thunder calling me
We've got summer right here in our hearts
And we move with the tide
We just float in the sun 'til the big wave comes
Then we ride ride ride
Then we ride ride ride
Then we ride ride ride
We've got summer right here in our hearts
And we move with the tide
We just float in the sun 'til the big wave comes
Then we ride ride ride
